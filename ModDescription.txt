Each bonus is set according to the following formula.

BonusValue = numTerriotries + N.

Typicaly N is -1 for many maps. This mods makes it easy to make this the case on all maps.
Bonuses that are 0 or negative can be excluded from the mod.

Note: The mod do not work correctely for superbonuses (bonuses, that contain other bonuses)
