Each bonus is set according to the following formula.

BonusValue = numTerriotries + N

Typicaly N is -1 for many maps. This mods makes it easy to make this the case on all maps.
Bonuses that are 0 or negative can be excluded from the mod.

The mod also can work N as a multiplier.
BonusValue = numTerriotries * N
