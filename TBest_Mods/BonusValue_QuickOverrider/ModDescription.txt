Each bonus is by default set according to the following formula.

BonusValue = numTerritories + N

Typicaly N is -1 for the many of the competative templates. This mods makes it easy to make this the case on all maps.

Additionaly there are checkboxses to alter what formula is used. It makes it possible to override bonuses in several commen ways.
For example: numTerriroties + N, numTerriroties * N, deafultBonusValue + N, deafultBonusValue * N. 
There is also an optional X factor, that can randomely change each bonus by +/- X after any of the above formula is used.

Bonuses that are 0 or negative can be excluded from the mod the effects of this mod.
