Each bonus is by default set according to the following formula.

BonusValue = numTerritories + N

Typically N is -1 for the many of the competitive templates. This mods makes it easy to make this the case on all maps.

Additionally there are checkboxes to alter what formula is used. It makes it possible to override bonuses in several common ways.
For example: numTerriroties + N, numTerriroties * N, deafultBonusValue + N, deafultBonusValue * N. 
There is also an optional X factor, that can randomly change each bonus by +/- X after any of the above formulas is used.

Bonuses that are 0 or negative can be excluded from the effects of this mod.
