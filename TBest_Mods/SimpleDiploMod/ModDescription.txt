Players need to declear war on each other in order to attack. This is done using this mod's Menu.

A war ends if both players delete the Mod's war Order, or it exspires. Diplomacy cards WILL still prevnt players from attacking each other.
The mod will only last a set number of turn, to prevent stuck games.
